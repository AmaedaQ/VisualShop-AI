This is the visual search service for IntelliCart application.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the visual search service:

### 1. Clean Up Existing Files
⚠️ **Important**: Delete all existing files in this directory **EXCEPT** the `venv` folder. Keep the `venv` folder as is.

### 2. Add New Files
Copy all the files from the shared directory into this folder.

### 3. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Run the Service
```bash
python app.py
```

The visual search service should now be running and accessible.

## Notes
- Make sure you see `(venv)` in your command prompt when the virtual environment is activated
- Do not delete the `venv` folder - it contains your Python environment
- Only delete other files, keep the virtual environment intact
