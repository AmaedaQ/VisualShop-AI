# 🛒 VisualShop-AI — AI-Powered E-Commerce Platform

> ⚙️ Based on a real-world freelance engagement. Proprietary data has been removed; this repo highlights engineering capability in production-grade full-stack systems and applied AI integration.

---

## 🧩 Overview

**VisualShop-AI** is a microservices-based, AI-enhanced e-commerce platform tailored for multi-vendor marketplaces. It integrates **visual search**, **personalized recommendations**, and **automated workflows**, all built for performance and scale.

This open-source version reflects my work designing and implementing complex backend systems, AI pipelines, and user-focused frontend interfaces — with a strong emphasis on scalability, clarity, and production readiness.
